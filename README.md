# <BUDGET_BIRDiE>

## Description

The BUDGET BIRDiE Expense Tracker is an application that allows it's users to monitor, manage and track their financial transactions by category, amount and date with the ability to also delete added items to edit or correct input data. 
The application uses HTML, CSS Style Sheet, Bootstrap CSS Framework, and JavaScript. <br />
<br />
The motivation for this project comes from the desire to help individuals who struggle with finances and financial planning develop financial awareness habits in order to achieve long-term financial goals with a user-friendly website so it is accessible to all.
The tracker allows the user to track everyday spending with the capability of filtering listed items so they can identift where their funds are being allocated so that a budget can be created. <br />
<br />
This project allowed our team to learn what is needed to collaborate on the development of a functional front-end web application. We were able to navigate the project together to meet the acceptance criteria all the while learning through trial and error what methods are needed and better organizational skills for future projects.
